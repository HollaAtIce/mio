            <p> Hey, I'm a full stack JavaScript developer with a keen eye for developing solid products. Before learning to
                code, I co-founded and led
                <a class="link black hover-bg-red b" ui-sref="projects">The DIME</a>, a video classifieds app for iOS, from
                inception to completion. The DIME was one of the key inspirations behind me learning to code. </p>
            <p> I studied Journalism at USC and have worked on a couple political campaigns (websites) since graduating. In my
                spare time, I love connecting the dots between my side projects and technology. And, of course, exploring
                the city I was born and raised in-- Los Angeles.</p>
